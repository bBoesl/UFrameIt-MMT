<p>This math archive contains the elementary parts of the Math-in-the-Middle ontology. It
covers the same material as the <a href="http://mathhub.info/smglom/">SMGloM</a>
terminology. In particular the two are trivially aligned. Ideally, for each SMGloM
archive, we would have a MMT file that contains the same theories with the same
symbols. But this is unrealistic during development of both the SMGloM and this MitM
archive. So we only enforce a "unique name assumption": If there is a pair of symbols with
different names, they are "morally different". I.e. where the two ontologies overlap, they
are name-aligned.</p>
